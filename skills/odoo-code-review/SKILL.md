name: odoo-code-review
description: Source-code security review for Odoo using one Claude Code command with three lanes: Claude Code as lead reviewer/orchestrator, local Ollama/Qwen for private advisory triage, and Codex/OpenAI as the heavy worker for Odoo specialist hunters, discourse, chaining drafts, variant analysis, PoC/artifact work, and report drafting. Structured 0–8 phase audit of any Odoo addon repo. Phase 0 inventories modules + manifests. Phase 1 maps Odoo attack surface (routes/ACL/cron/mail). Phase 1.5 runs local Ollama/Qwen advisory triage for private first-pass module summaries and scanner-hint review. Phases 2–4.5 run Semgrep+custom Odoo rules, Bandit, ruff, pylint-odoo, OCA pre-commit, CodeQL Python, Joern (optional), Pysa, pip-audit, osv-scanner. Phase 5 delegates Odoo specialist hunter passes to Codex by default. Phase 5.5 delegates discourse draft to Codex, with Claude resolving disputes. Phase 6 uses Codex for chaining draft, Claude finalizes. Phase 7 uses Codex evidence packs/variant drafts, Claude performs final 6-gate verdicts. Phase 7.5 runtime testing and Phase 7.6 attack graphs are Codex/script heavy. Phase 8 uses Codex report draft, Claude final edits. Use when the user asks for a security review, code review, "audit this Odoo repo", appsec review, vuln hunt, or pentest of Odoo source. Outputs evidence-backed findings only — no scanner noise, no theoretical concerns, no style nits.

# Code Review — Odoo

Structured, technique-organized AI security review of an Odoo source-code repository. Tuned for the two trust boundaries that matter in Odoo: **public-vs-authenticated** (`auth='public'`) and **user-vs-root** (`sudo()`).

## When to Use

- User asks for a security review, code review, source-code audit, appsec review, vuln hunt, pentest of source, or "audit this Odoo repo".
- Engagement is source-only (no live target) or starts with source.
- Repo contains custom Odoo addons (community/enterprise/OCA/third-party) — single addon to multi-million LOC.
- Findings need to be defensible to a client (evidence + reproduction + impact, not "scanner says so").

## When NOT to Use

- Single-file or single-PR review — use `superpowers:requesting-code-review`, `everything-claude-code:code-review`, or `differential-review` instead.
- Style / lint / dependency-CVE-only checks — use the relevant linter or `supply-chain-risk-auditor`.
- Live black-box pentest — use `wooyun-legacy` or `ffuf-web-fuzzing` skills.
- Threat modeling without code review — use `openai-security-threat-model`.
- Non-Odoo Python projects — the surface model and 10 hunters are Odoo-specific. For generic Python, use `everything-claude-code:python-review`.

## Hard Rules (Do Not Negotiate)

1. **Real exploitability only.** No theoretical, no "could be bad if X", no missing-input-validation without a dangerous sink shown.
2. **Cite evidence.** Every finding lands on a `file:line` and includes a concrete payload or reproducer (curl, XML-RPC, JSON-RPC, browser action, odoo-bin shell).
3. **Verify hunter claims by reading the actual code.** Hunters are smart but hallucinate. Phase 7 reads the bytes.
4. **No re-reporting fixed CVEs** unless you prove a regression in this codebase.
5. **Skip scanner noise.** Style, naming, "best practice without exploitability" — drop on the floor.
6. **Match severity to actual blast radius.** Internal-user → broader read != portal → internal user. DoS != RCE. Default-config != opt-in misuse.
7. **Match scope to what was asked.** Don't scope-creep into refactoring, fixes, or PRs unless the user asks.

## Rationalizations to Reject

| Rationalization                                     | Reality                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "It's documented as the developer's responsibility" | If the API is the footgun (e.g., `sudo()`), it's still worth flagging — DOWNGRADE not REJECT. |
| "Browsers don't allow that"                         | Verify against RFCs. Server-to-server (XML-RPC, webhooks) often still applies.                |
| "It's behind authentication"                        | Portal != admin. `auth='user'` != `auth='public'`. Many bugs cross those boundaries.          |
| "It's an internal app"                              | Internal Odoo gets owned via SSRF, lateral movement, credential reuse, mass-assignment.       |
| "The ORM handles SQL injection"                     | `cr.execute()` bypasses the ORM. Identifiers can't be parameterised. ORDER BY isn't escaped.  |
| "QWeb auto-escapes"                                 | `t-raw` and `Markup()` and `fields.Html(sanitize=False)` all bypass.                          |
| "The user has admin already"                        | Admin can already do RCE — but cross-company / cross-tenant escalation still matters.         |
| "It's just DoS"                                     | Production DoS is a paging incident. HIGH if pre-auth + cheap.                                |
| "The hunter said it's a bug, ship it"               | Hunters hallucinate. Phase 7 reads the source.                                                |
| "I'll explain verbally"                             | No artifact = finding lost. Write the report.                                                 |

## The Phases

Run them in order. Don't skip Phase 0/1 — without the module inventory and attack surface map, hunters waste time on dead code. Don't skip Phase 7 — without verification, false positives reach the client.

## Local Runner

Start every `/odoo-code-review` run by invoking the bundled runner:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/odoo-code-review/scripts/odoo-review-run <target> <flags>
```

The runner handles preflight, output directory creation, manifest inventory, attack-surface indexing, scanner execution, Ollama/Qwen advisory output, and Codex hunter launch/prompt prep. Claude Code then continues with discourse, chaining, Phase 7 validation, severity decisions, and final report editing.

Use `--codex-mode prepare` when Codex prompts should be reviewed or launched manually. Use the default `--codex-mode run` for the full one-command three-lane workflow.

## One-Command Three-Lane Orchestration

When run from Claude Code via `/odoo-code-review`, use all three lanes in one run:

| Lane           | Invocation                 | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lead reviewer  | Claude Code session        | Scope, orchestration, risk judgment, dispute resolution, final 6-gate verdicts, final report edit                                                                              |
| Local advisory | `ollama run <local-model>` | Phase 1.5 private module notes, scanner triage, obvious reject candidates                                                                                                      |
| Heavy worker   | `codex exec` / Codex CLI   | Phase 5 hunters, Phase 5.5 discourse draft, Phase 6 chaining draft, Phase 7 variant/evidence packs, PoC writeability, runtime/ZAP harness support, attack graphs, report draft |

Qwen output is always `HINT` only and cannot create ACCEPT findings, reject findings, or set final severity. Codex does the expensive reading and drafting, but Claude remains the final arbiter for ACCEPT/DOWNGRADE/REJECT, severity, and client-ready wording.

Codex invocation pattern:

```bash
codex exec -C <repo> -m gpt-5.3-codex -s read-only --ask-for-approval never -o <OUT>/codex/<task>.md -- "<task prompt>"
```

Use `-s workspace-write` only for artifact-generation tasks under `<OUT>` such as runtime harnesses, DOT/SVG attack graphs, and report drafts. Never let Codex modify source unless the user explicitly asks for fixes.

### Phase 0 — Odoo Module Inventory + Manifest Map

Enumerate every addon. Parse every `__manifest__.py` (name, version, depends, data, external_dependencies, license). Build the depends-graph. Tag origin (core/enterprise/OCA/custom/third-party). Index every `data:` entry so Phase 1 and Phase 5 can grep into them. Writes `<OUT>/00-modules.md` and `<OUT>/inventory/`.

### Phase 1 — Odoo Attack Surface Map

Identify Odoo version + edition + Python + Postgres + Werkzeug. Map HTTP routes (`@http.route` decorators with auth/csrf/type/methods), RPC entry points (`xmlrpc/2/object`, `jsonrpc`), portal routes (`/my/*`), models touched by public/portal routes, ACL CSV rows, `ir.rule` records, server actions, cron, mail templates. Risk-rank modules 1–5. Plan hunter assignments. Writes `<OUT>/01-attack-surface.md`.

See `references/workflow.md` Phase 1 for the full checklist.

### Phase 1.5 — Local Qwen / Ollama Advisory Check

Runs by default in the one-command Claude Code workflow unless `--no-local-qwen` is set. This is a local-only, no-cloud advisory pass through Ollama after Phase 1 and again after scanner output exists. Default model: `qwen3:0.6b`, override with `--local-model <ollama-model>`.

Use it for privacy-preserving first-pass summaries, module risk notes, scanner output triage, and obvious reject candidates. Treat Qwen output as hints only. It cannot create ACCEPT findings, change severity, or replace Phase 7 verification.

Outputs → `<OUT>/local-qwen/module-notes.md`, `<OUT>/local-qwen/scanner-triage.md`, and `<OUT>/local-qwen/reject-candidates.md`.

### Phase 2 — Semgrep Python/Odoo Rules

Community rulesets: `p/python`, `p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/trailofbits`, `p/0xdea`. Custom rules in `.semgrep/odoo.yml` covering `auth='public'+sudo()`, `csrf=False` without HMAC, `cr.execute(f"...")`, `t-raw=` on user data, `request.params` → `write/create`, `ir.config_parameter.set_param` from controllers, `with_user(env.ref('base.user_admin'))`, etc.

### Phase 2.5 — Bandit Sweep

Generic Python AppSec issues Semgrep misses (assert in prod, tempfile.mktemp, weak hashes, hardcoded passwords).

### Phase 2.6 — Ruff + pylint-odoo + OCA pre-commit

Ruff with `select=["S","B","PIE","BLE","ARG","RET"]`. `pylint --load-plugins=pylint_odoo --enable=odoolint`. OCA pre-commit. `pylint-odoo` is the bridge — knows `@api.model`, `_name`, `_inherit`, Translation, `<record>` rules.

### Phase 3 — CodeQL Python Dataflow

`codeql database create --build-mode=none --language=python` then analyze with `python-security-and-quality.qls` and `python-security-experimental.qls`.

### Phase 3.5 — Joern Graph Review (Optional)

Triggered by `--joern`. CPG-based graph traversal catches multi-hop / `getattr`-dispatched / metaclass-resolved flows CodeQL standard suites miss. Build CPG via `joern-parse <repo> --language pythonsrc`, run query batch (eval/exec/safe_eval reachability, cr.execute non-literal, sudo propagation, controller→model paths, deserialization, SSRF, path traversal). Treat hits as leads for Phase 5, not findings. Skip when SMALL (<20k LOC) or `--quick`.

### Phase 4 — Pysa Optional Taint Analysis

`pyre analyze --no-verify`. Skip if Pyre setup fails (Odoo's metaclass-heavy ORM often confuses it). Catches multi-hop taint Semgrep misses.

### Phase 4.5 — Dependency Scan

`pip-audit` + `osv-scanner`. Cross-reference manifest external_dependencies with Phase 1 reachability.

Full commands: `references/automated-scans.md`. Output is **hints not truth** — feed to hunters, verify in Phase 7.

### Phase 5 — Odoo Specialist Hunters via Codex

Delegate the 9 technique hunter passes to Codex by default to preserve Claude limits. Each owns one technique class across the whole repo. Hunters get the Phase 0 module map + Phase 1 surface map + Phase 1.5 Qwen hints + Phase 2–4.5 scan paths. Write outputs to `<OUT>/agents/hunter-*.md`.

Claude's job in Phase 5 is to prepare compact packets, launch/track Codex tasks, and spot-check returned claims before Phase 5.5. Claude should not spend context doing full hunter sweeps unless Codex is unavailable.

The 10 Odoo hunters:

1. **Access Control** — ACL CSV, `ir.rule`, groups, `sudo()`/`with_user()`/`with_context()` misuse
2. **Controller / Route** — `@http.route`, `request.params/jsonrequest`, CSRF, IDOR, mass-assignment
3. **ORM / SQL / Domain** — `cr.execute`, raw SQL, domain injection, `search([])`, `unlink()`, mass-assignment
4. **QWeb / XSS** — `t-raw`, `Markup()`, `fields.Html(sanitize=False)`, mail body, OWL `innerHTML`
5. **Business Logic** — state machines, races, workflow bypass, `ir.actions.server` `state='code'`, cron
6. **Secrets / Config** — hardcoded secrets, `ir.config_parameter`, `odoo.conf`, debug PIN, `list_db`/`admin_passwd`
7. **External Integration** — `requests`/`urllib`/SSRF, webhook signature verify, mail header injection, LDAP, OAuth
8. **Data Exposure** — `/my/*` portal, `ir.attachment` `public=True`, chatter, reports, xmlrpc enumeration
9. **Dependency** — `requirements.txt`, OCA pins, base image, JS deps in `static/src`
10. **Chaining** — runs after #1–9 in Phase 6, combines lower-severity findings into higher-impact paths

Full prompt templates: `references/agent-prompts.md`.

### Phase 5.5 — Discourse / Cross-Hunter FP Reduction

Delegate the first discourse draft to Codex. Hunters review each other's findings using AGREE / CHALLENGE / CONNECT / SURFACE tags. Claude resolves disputed CHALLENGE items and decides what enters Phase 6. Skip only if `--quick` or repo SMALL.

Pattern: `references/discourse.md`.

### Phase 6 — Cross-Agent Correlation (Chaining)

Ask Codex for a chaining draft, then have Claude finalize. Combine findings into higher-impact paths. The Odoo trust model amplifies certain combos:

- `auth='public'` + `sudo()` + sensitive model = **unauthenticated data dump**
- Mass-assignment on `res.users.group_ids` + `auth='user'` = **user → admin**
- QWeb `t-raw` + `message_post` from portal = **stored XSS in admin chatter**
- SQL injection in `cr.execute` + `database.secret` leak = **session forgery + DB write**
- `safe_eval` sandbox bypass + `ir.cron` `user_root` = **persistent RCE**

The chaining hunter (#10) gets discourse-CONNECT entries as high-prior chain candidates.

### Phase 7 — Validation (6-Gate fp-check + Variant Analysis + Negative Space)

Three sub-passes:

1. **Codex evidence pack per finding** — source context, reachability trace, attacker-control notes, PoC sketch, assumptions.
2. **Claude 6-gate fp-check per finding** — source-matches → reachable → attacker-controls → realistic-preconditions → pseudocode-PoC → impact-matches-severity. ACCEPT only if all 6 PASS. (`references/fp-check.md`)
3. **Codex variant analysis draft on each ACCEPT** — extract bug shape, fan out grep/Semgrep across the whole repo, group siblings under the parent finding. Claude reviews the grouped variants. (`references/variant-analysis.md`)
4. **Negative-space audit** — Codex drafts checklist coverage; Claude confirms any reportable gaps. (`references/insecure-defaults.md`, distinct from `references/sharp-edges.md`.)

Triage:

- **ACCEPT** — all 6 gates PASS. Real, exploitable, meaningful impact.
- **DOWNGRADE** — gates 1–5 PASS, gate 6 fails — keep finding, lower severity.
- **REJECT** — any of gates 1–3 FAIL.
- **NEEDS MANUAL TESTING** — plausible from source but a gate requires runtime confirmation.

Triage rubric + output format: `references/triage.md`.

### Phase 7.5 — Runtime Odoo Testing (Optional)

Triggered by `--runtime`. Two sub-passes:

- **Sub-pass A — odoo-bin disposable.** Boot disposable Odoo, replay ACCEPT-finding PoCs via real HTTP / `odoo-bin shell` / `odoo-bin --test-enable`. Capture stdout/stderr/HTTP under `<OUT>/runtime/reproductions/`.
- **Sub-pass B — ZAP baseline (only if `--zap-target <url>`).** Run `zap-baseline.py` against the booted Odoo. macOS Docker quirk: mount needs `--user 0` and `chmod 777` on the wrk dir. Output → `<OUT>/runtime/zap/zap-baseline.{html,json}`.

Required when Gate 5 (PoC) demands runtime evidence.

### Phase 7.6 — Attack Graph DOT/SVG (Chained Findings)

Auto-runs when Phase 6 produced 2+ chained findings. Emits Graphviz DOT + rendered SVG per chain to `<OUT>/attack-graphs/chain-N.{dot,svg}`. Nodes = entry point / model / action. Edges = trust-boundary crossings (anonymous→authenticated, user→sudo, portal→internal, tenant A→B, internal→root). Embedded inline in `findings.html` so report stays self-contained.

### Phase 7.7 — Codex Adversarial Check

Runs by default on CRITICAL/HIGH ACCEPT findings unless `--no-codex` is set. Because Codex already performed heavy evidence work, this pass must use a fresh Codex prompt/session that sees only the final finding card and source snippets, not the prior Codex draft. Each finding is handed to Codex/OpenAI for independent verdict + PoC-write attempt. Reconciliation table:

| Codex                   | odoo-code-review | Result                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ACCEPT                  | ACCEPT          | keep ACCEPT, +1 confidence                    |
| REJECT                  | ACCEPT          | force NEEDS-MANUAL, log disagreement          |
| DOWNGRADE               | ACCEPT          | re-evaluate severity if limiting factor sound |
| writes PoC              | no PoC          | attach Codex PoC, raise confidence            |
| no PoC and no other PoC | n/a             | downgrade to NEEDS-MANUAL                     |
| ACCEPT                  | DOWNGRADE       | keep DOWNGRADE, note Codex stronger view      |

Outputs → `<OUT>/codex/second-opinion/verdicts/F-N.md` + `<OUT>/codex/second-opinion/reconciliation.md`.

### Phase 7.8 — Requirements-Aware Verification (Optional)

Triggered by `--requirements <file>`. Extract claims → compile predicates → dispatch judges → repair-loop (≤2 rounds) → R-N findings. Catches missed-requirement bugs.

Procedure: `references/requirements-mode.md`.

### Phase 8 — Output Assembly

Have Codex draft `findings.md`, `findings.html`, `findings.json` when requested, and `tooling.md` from the verified Phase 7 records. Claude performs the final edit, removes unsupported claims, checks severity language, and ensures every ACCEPT has evidence and a 6-gate table.

Each Phase 5 hunter MUST be tracked as its own TaskCreate so the user sees progress and so completion notifications map cleanly.

## Flags

- `--out <dir>` — override default `<repo>/.audit/` output dir.
- `--with-discourse` / `--no-discourse` — force Phase 5.5 on/off (default: on except `--quick`).
- `--quick` — skip Phases 2–4.5 + Phase 5.5; hunters only on Phase 0/1 maps.
- `--no-local-qwen` — skip local Ollama/Qwen advisory triage.
- `--local-model <name>` — override local Ollama model (default: `qwen3:0.6b`).
- `--allow-missing-lanes` — continue if the local Qwen or Codex lane is unavailable; record the skip in `tooling.md`.
- `--joern` — enable Phase 3.5 Joern CPG graph review (skip on SMALL or `--quick`).
- `--runtime` — enable Phase 7.5 sub-pass A (odoo-bin disposable + PoC replay).
- `--zap-target <url>` — also run Phase 7.5 sub-pass B (ZAP baseline). Requires `--runtime`.
- `--no-codex` — skip Codex heavy-worker lane and Phase 7.7 adversarial check; Claude performs all review work locally.
- `--requirements <file>` — enable Phase 7.8 requirements-aware verification.
- `--no-html` — skip `findings.html` generation in Phase 8 (default: on).
- `--json` — emit `findings.json` sidecar in Phase 8.
- `--modules <list>` — restrict scope to comma-separated module names.
- `--odoo-version <N>` — override Odoo version detection (e.g., `17.0`).

## Reference Files

Load only what applies to the engagement:

- `references/lang-odoo.md` — Odoo framework patterns (manifest, models, controllers, ACL, sudo, safe_eval)
- `references/lang-qweb.md` — QWeb / OWL templating sinks (`t-raw`, `Markup`, mail body, `innerHTML`)
- `references/lang-python.md` — generic Python AppSec (Django/Flask/FastAPI fallbacks, SQLAlchemy, pickle/yaml)
- `references/lang-web.md` — TypeScript/Node (only relevant for `static/src` JS)
- `references/sharp-edges.md` — footgun APIs incl. Odoo section
- `references/insecure-defaults.md` — config-level defaults incl. Odoo section

## Output

Phase 8 emits two reports — `findings.md` (canonical, line-citable) and `findings.html` (single-file, self-contained, severity color-coded, embedded SVG attack graphs). `--no-html` skips HTML; `--json` adds `findings.json` sidecar.

Every engagement ends with:

1. **Findings table** — Title / Severity / Confidence / Affected Files / Triage.
2. **Per-finding detail** — full Odoo finding format from `references/agent-prompts.md` Common Header. Each ACCEPT carries:
   - 6-row fp-check gate table (`references/fp-check.md`)
   - Variants sub-table (`references/variant-analysis.md`)
   - `Odoo surface:` field (route / model / view / cron / wizard / server-action)
   - Codex 2nd-opinion verdict + reconciliation note for CRITICAL/HIGH ACCEPT findings
3. **Chained attack paths** — one block per chain, with embedded Phase 7.6 SVG.
4. **Negative-space summary** — insecure-defaults missed by hunters (`references/insecure-defaults.md` Odoo section).
5. **Discourse summary** — consensus / challenged / connected / surfaced (Phase 5.5 record).
6. **Engagement stats** — modules, LOC scanned, wall-clock, tokens used, hunter-by-hunter table.
7. **Reproducibility appendix** — `<OUT>/tooling.md`: Odoo version, model/provider lane table, Semgrep ruleset hashes (incl. custom `.semgrep/odoo.yml@<sha>`), CodeQL pack versions, Ollama/Qwen version, Joern/ZAP/Codex/Graphviz versions, exact commands run.
8. **Recommended actions** — file upstream issue (with OCA / Odoo S.A. / vendor), hardening PR, or no action with reason.

Stats demonstrate AI speed-up to client/AppSec leadership. Never skip them.

| MEDIUM (5–30 modules, 20k–200k LOC) | All 10 hunters, single pass. ~5–10 min wall-clock.                                                    |
| LARGE (30–100 modules, 200k–2M LOC) | Hunters with module-scoping (split risk-5 from risk-1). ~10–20 min wall-clock.                        |
| HUGE (>100 modules, >2M LOC)        | Multi-pass: hunters first run on highest-risk modules only, then expand. Discuss scope cap with user. |

## Philosophy

For Odoo, Semgrep + custom Odoo rules + CodeQL/Pysa + agent validation beats adding a pile of generic scanners. The money is in finding **"public route calls sudo and returns sensitive model data"** — not 400 generic Python warnings.

Hunters know Odoo semantics. The two trust boundaries (`auth='public'` and `sudo()`) anchor every triage decision. Severity reflects whose data crosses which boundary.
